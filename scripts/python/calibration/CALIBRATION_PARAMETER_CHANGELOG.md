# Calibration Parameter Changelog
Author: Max Stoddard

## Purpose And Maintenance Rule
This is the canonical calibration provenance ledger for Python-driven and related parameter updates.

Maintenance requirements:
- Update this file in the same change whenever non-legacy calibration outputs, defaults, methods, or script paths change.
- Keep this file append-only in the version-history section.
- Each script entry must include:
  - script path
  - outputs/keys produced
  - exact runnable command
  - expected-result snippet
  - method chosen
  - method-selection decision logic
  - rationale category
  - evidence links
  - version(s) affected

## Method-Selection Rationale Framework (Prerequisite For New Entries)
Before adding any new or updated script entry to this file, record a brief
decision-logic line using this framework:
- Primary objective:
  - `target reproduction`, or
  - `stability/robustness`, or
  - `backward compatibility`
  - `direct method justification` (diagnostic or policy-choice experiments)
- Why this method wins under the chosen objective.
- What key tradeoff is accepted (for example: slight reproduction error in
  exchange for better robustness or compatibility).

Required entry field format:
- Method-selection decision logic:
  - `Objective=<...>; Why=<...>; Tradeoff=<...>`
