# UK Housing Model Dashboard
Author: Max Stoddard

Local React dashboard for visualizing `input-data-versions/` model parameters, with optional version comparison and provenance tracking.

## Run

From repository root:

```bash
./run-dashboard.sh
```

## Useful commands

```bash
cd dashboard
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test:smoke
npm run start:server
```

## Production Runtime

The frontend can call either same-origin API routes or an external API base URL.

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (optional): absolute API origin, for example `https://uk-housing-market-abm-api.onrender.com`
  - if unset, frontend calls relative `/api/*` paths.

Dashboard API environment variables:

- `PORT` (preferred in production): HTTP port.
- `DASHBOARD_API_PORT` (local fallback): HTTP port when `PORT` is not set.
- `DASHBOARD_CORS_ORIGIN` (optional): allowed browser origin for cross-origin requests (for split frontend/API deploys).
- `DASHBOARD_ENABLE_MODEL_RUNS` (optional): set to `true` to enable dev-only model-run APIs/UI.
- `DASHBOARD_WRITE_USERNAME` + `DASHBOARD_WRITE_PASSWORD` (optional pair): enables write-login mode when both are set.
- `DASHBOARD_MAVEN_BIN` (optional): Maven executable used by model runs (defaults to `mvn`).
- `DASHBOARD_RESULTS_CAP_MB` (optional): total `Results/` storage cap in MB for dashboard-managed runs (defaults to `400`). New run submissions are blocked when usage is at/above cap after managed-run pruning.
- `DASHBOARD_LOG_MEMORY` (optional): set to `true` to log request duration plus RSS/heap deltas for public API routes.

Experiments availability:

- Experiments are intentionally dev-only.
- Production and `Preview non-dev` hide the `Experiments` navigation item and do not expose `/experiments` or `/login`.
- In non-dev, experiment/model-run/results-management/auth-for-experiments API routes return `404` so the feature is absent rather than blocked.
- The homepage no longer shows git-history stats; production avoids all git/GitHub diff work entirely.

Write-access behavior:

- If `DASHBOARD_WRITE_USERNAME` and `DASHBOARD_WRITE_PASSWORD` are both unset:
  - auth is disabled,
  - local development can use write features without login.
- If both are set:
  - dashboard write actions require login (single global username/password),
  - read-only pages remain available without login.
- If model runs are enabled (`DASHBOARD_ENABLE_MODEL_RUNS=true`) but credentials are unset:
  - API enters fail-closed mode for write actions (`503`),
  - login is intentionally disabled until credentials are configured,
  - read-only pages remain available.

Write actions requiring login in auth-enabled mode:

- queue model runs
- cancel model runs
- clear finished jobs from queue history
- delete manual result runs from Experiments (`type=manual`, `mode=view`)
- start sensitivity experiments
- cancel sensitivity experiments
- cancel unified experiment jobs (`POST /api/experiments/jobs/:jobRef/cancel`)

Sensitivity API endpoints:

- `GET /api/experiments/sensitivity`
- `POST /api/experiments/sensitivity`
- `GET /api/experiments/sensitivity/:experimentId`
- `GET /api/experiments/sensitivity/:experimentId/results`
- `GET /api/experiments/sensitivity/:experimentId/charts`
- `GET /api/experiments/sensitivity/:experimentId/logs`
- `POST /api/experiments/sensitivity/:experimentId/cancel`

Unified experiment monitoring endpoints:

- `GET /api/experiments/jobs`
- `GET /api/experiments/jobs/:jobRef/logs`
- `POST /api/experiments/jobs/:jobRef/cancel`

Experiments route:

- Available only in local dev view; production and `Preview non-dev` redirect `/experiments` to `/`.
- Unified page at `/experiments` with query-based selectors.
- `type=manual|sensitivity` and `mode=run|view` drive setup/results combinations.
- optional focus params: `jobRef` (run mode queue/log), `runId` (manual view), `experimentId` (sensitivity view).

KPI definitions (tail-120 window, used for manual KPI cards and sensitivity analytics):

- `Mean`: arithmetic mean of the tail-120 monthly values.
- `CV`: `stdev / abs(mean)`; returns `null` when `abs(mean)` is near zero.
- `Annualised Trend`: OLS monthly slope multiplied by `12`.
- `Range`: `P95 - P5` using linear percentile interpolation.

Sensitivity behavior:

- one-at-a-time numeric USER SET parameter sweeps (manual min/max, baseline-in-range required)
- 5-point sampling (`min`, `mid-lower`, `baseline`, `mid-upper`, `max`) with integer rounding and duplicate collapse
- summary-first retention by default (per-point outputs deleted after summary extraction)
- optional full-output retention under `Results/experiments/sensitivity/<experimentId>/points`
- persisted experiment metadata + chart-ready summaries under `Results/experiments/sensitivity/<experimentId>`
- merged live logs with lifecycle markers + stdout/stderr stream under sensitivity and unified logs endpoints
- tornado charts support KPI-basis selection (`Mean`, `CV`, `Annualised Trend`, `Range`)
- manual run submissions are blocked while a sensitivity experiment is active, and sensitivity submissions are blocked while manual jobs are active

### Local Auth Setup

Default local workflow (no login lockout):

```bash
cd dashboard
npm run dev
```

Local development defaults:

- when running in local dev (`NODE_ENV != production`), dashboard requests run in dev view mode by default.
- dev view mode bypasses write-auth configuration lockouts so `Experiments` run mode is usable without setting credentials.
- actual run execution still requires Java and Maven in the API runtime.
- use the `Preview non-dev` toggle in the app header (shown in dev) to switch to the same hidden experiments state used by Render production.

Optional local auth testing (login required):

```bash
cd dashboard
export DASHBOARD_ENABLE_MODEL_RUNS=true
export DASHBOARD_WRITE_USERNAME=admin
export DASHBOARD_WRITE_PASSWORD=change-me
npm run dev
```

Then open `/login` in the web app and sign in with that username/password.

Health endpoint:

- `GET /healthz`
- `GET /api/runtime-deps` (runtime diagnostics):
  - returns `java`, `maven`, `mavenBin`, and `versionInfo` for dependency checks.

Homepage preview endpoint:

- `GET /api/home-preview?version=<version>`
- returns only the lightweight chart payload needed for the homepage hero preview
- avoids provenance history, dataset attribution, and other compare-page metadata
- keeps the homepage live without forcing the full compare path on first public load

## Render Deployment

Repository root includes `render.yaml` with:

- static web service: `uk-housing-market-abm`
- API web service: `uk-housing-market-abm-api` (slim Docker runtime for public dashboard APIs)

The public Render API is intentionally lightweight:

- Dockerfile: `dashboard/Dockerfile.api`
- ships only the public dashboard server plus `input-data-versions`
- does not include git, Java, Maven, or baseline `Results/` outputs
- uses compiled server output (`dist-server`) instead of running through `tsx`

Render production defaults to `DASHBOARD_ENABLE_MODEL_RUNS=false`, which removes experiments from the live website and disables the related API surface.

If you intentionally want remote experiment execution again, treat it as a separate service concern. The public 512 MB instance is not intended to host model execution or results analytics.

Local development remains the supported way to use experiments. If you still want to re-enable them in another environment, start with:

- `DASHBOARD_ENABLE_MODEL_RUNS=true`
- `DASHBOARD_WRITE_USERNAME` (secret)
- `DASHBOARD_WRITE_PASSWORD` (secret)

Deploys are configured from `master` and gated by passing GitHub checks.

If Render stops showing commit events (for example, "No event for this commit"), first re-link the service repository in Render to the current GitHub repo identity (`max-stoddard/UK-Housing-Market-ABM`) and re-sync the Blueprint.

Optional resilience fallback:

- add `RENDER_STATIC_DEPLOY_HOOK` and `RENDER_API_DEPLOY_HOOK` as GitHub repository secrets
- `.github/workflows/dashboard-ci.yml` will call these hooks after checks pass on `master`, only when matching service paths changed
